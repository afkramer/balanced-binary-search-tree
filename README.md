# balanced-binary-search-tree
My solution to the Balanced Binary Search Tree Project from The Odin Project

## What I learned
This was such a fun way to dive deeper into data structures. I think that the Binary Search Tree will play a big role in the next projects (for example chess). To keep track of all possible moves for the computer player, I'm guessing that a binary search tree will make a lot of sense.

It was also good practice for recursion -- wherever possible I tried to use recursion. And it was a good revisit to how you can pass blocks to a method and yield values to the block.

## Areas to improve on
I'm sure that when I take a look at other students' code I'll see a lot that I can improve on, but generally I'm happy with how I was able to implement these methods. It was really tough but extremely rewarding when it finally all came together.
